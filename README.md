## Requirements

SoundLab requires recording and storage permissions.

## Storage
SoundLab will make a folder named 'SoundLab'.
Recorded files will be stored in 'SoundLab\'.
Please copy files to be played to SoundLab\PlayList.

## PCM

Playing and recording only support .pcm file. PLease refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-code_modulation for more information about pcm encoding.

## Instructions from top to bottom.

## Play:

Played file selection.

Playing parameters selection:
- ContentType: MUSIC/CALL
- ChannelMask: STEREO/MONO
- SampleRate: 48000/44100/16000/8000

Refer to `AudioTrack.Builder()`.

State display: Ready/Playing/Pause/Reset

Left time in seconds.

Action buttons: START/PAUSE/RESET


## Record:

Check the checkbox of 'Record' and use 'START' button to record sound.

Recording parameters selection:
- AudioSource: MIC/UNPROCESSED/CAMCORDER
- ChannelMask: STEREO/MONO
- SampleRate: 48000/44100

Refer to `AudioRecord.Builder()`.

The default file name will be current time like '20220102040506.pcm'.
File name prefix will be added before the default file name. For example, 'PrefixTest20220102040506.pcm'

Action buttons: START/STOP.

## Info display

### Sound Volume

Two recording channel volume display gives a volume in dB. However, it is not calibrated, the volume number is for reference only.
For stereo recording, two channels will be displayed separately.
For mono channel recording, two channels will be the same.
The bottom value number is the average volume of two channels.

### Buffer Usage

The program records and saves data to file immediately. The same data will also be sent to a buffer for further process like volume calculation.
Buffer usage indicates the usage of buffer. From empty 0% to full 100%.
If it increase continuously, it means the data processing speed is lower than data generation speed.
When the buffer if full (nearly 100%). New data will not be able to added to the buffer.

### Log

Build in light weight log display for debug.
